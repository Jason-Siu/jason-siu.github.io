      <description>Introduction Hey everyone.&#xA;Hope everyone is doing good.&#xA;The job hunt in this industry is absolutely brutal. Not just in cybersecurity, but all of tech.&#xA;Things like software engineers, developers, IT, and cybersecurity - the job market is horrific as of late 2023 and early 2024. It&amp;rsquo;s so bad that even experienced veterans in the field are struggling too.&#xA;I recently accepted the role as an application security analyst at Paycom.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!&#xA;This is my presentation from CSG Firetalks about my experience penetration testing into a web app called &amp;ldquo;Sesame&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;CSG officers and students there really enjoyed this presentation and I hope you will too.&#xA;This was my first real break into penetration testing and I learned a lot of things from communicating bugs, to actual penetration testing.&#xA;Have a great rest of the day, and I hope you learned something &amp;ndash; Jason</description>

      <description>Hello!&#xA;Once again, today we have another CTF writeup, yet again.&#xA;Today&amp;rsquo;s CTF will be Chillhack from TryHackMe, but despite the title, it&amp;rsquo;s anything but chill.&#xA;It involves the use of multiple techniques, such as reverse shell, remote code execution bypassing, steganography, horizonal escalation, code analysis and more. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty involved.&#xA;You can read my PDF writeup here.&#xA;Thanks for reading, &amp;ndash; Jason</description>
