<p>Hey everyone.</p>
<p>Hope everyone is doing good.</p>
<p>The job hunt in this industry is absolutely brutal. Not just in cybersecurity, but all of tech.</p>
<p>Things like software engineers, developers, IT, and cybersecurity - the job market is horrific as of late 2023 and early 2024. It&rsquo;s so bad that even experienced veterans in the field are struggling too.</p>
<p>I recently accepted the role as an application security analyst at Paycom.</p>
<p>So, I am writing this in hopes that it helps someone who comes across this blog post, particularly anyone who is looking to be an application security analyst at Paycom.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-got-the-interview">How I got the interview</h2>
<p>First, I applied through the company website. A couple of days later I got an email inviting me to an interview.</p>
<p>My resume had my projects, internships and experience on it. It also had that I was a committee speaker in CSG, the cyberescurity club at UT Dallas and that I was CompTIA Security+ certified.</p>
<p>For Paycom, there are 3 interviews and 1 assessment.</p>
<h2 id="interview-1">Interview 1</h2>
<p>The first interview is with a recruiter. This interview was just basic questions about web application security (XSS, hashing vs encryption, SQLi, OWASP Top 10).</p>
<p>Just make sure you explain well, it&rsquo;s mainly &ldquo;explain xyz&rdquo; questions. They also asked at the beginning &ldquo;tell me about yourself&rdquo;, and this happened in all interviews.</p>
<p>Remember, the recruiter (though technical) just knows very basic information, so all you need to have to more information than them. I would intentionally sometimes go off into tangents about different technologies I would use and how they work just so that I would appear knowledgeable, smart and curious.</p>
<p>Because to the recruiter, I actually am.</p>
<p>Remember that this interview is only the first one, so you don&rsquo;t really need to be perfect, it&rsquo;s just a matter if you&rsquo;re knowledgable enough - which comes in both explaining things well enough and what things you know.</p>
<p>It really felt like I was teaching the interviewer, as opposed to just standard Q&amp;A like a regular interview.</p>
<p>Once passed, they will send you an assessment after this.</p>
<h2 id="the-assessment">The Assessment</h2>
<p>The assessment is a 25 question standard test which has primarily multiple choice, but also a few &ldquo;Select all that apply&rdquo; questions.</p>
<p>This is slightly more difficult than the technical interview, and honestly a lot of the difficult questions are from here, since they were trickier as with a lot of multiple choice tests. These covered more topics on top of the basic web application security questions from the first interview, but still mainly surface level on those topics.</p>
<p>The topics included:</p>
<ul>
<li>IDOR</li>
<li>OWASP Top 10 (Make sure you know all of them)</li>
<li>PHP insecure code review</li>
<li>Mitigating and preventing attacks</li>
<li>CSP (Content Security Policy) and output encoding</li>
<li>JWT (JSON web token)</li>
<li>identifying examples from the OWASP Top 10, (ie: which one of these is security and data integrity failure)</li>
<li>interception proxies and needing a new browser certificate</li>
<li>SQLi vs XSS and knowing the different types of SQLi and XSS</li>
<li>HTTP Status codes (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499, 500-599)</li>
<li>what is robots.txt, what&rsquo;s it used for?</li>
<li>Thinking like an attacker (2 questions give you a screenshot, and they ask what attacks would you do)</li>
<li>clickjacking, mass assignment, content spoofing</li>
<li>MD5 (just know that it&rsquo;s a weak hashing algorithm)</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have questions about WAF, OSI model, DNS, or networking stuff.</p>
<p>I had at times where I was stuck between 2 choices, which is where I found it tricky.</p>
<p>Anywho, after that they will let you know that you passed.</p>
<h2 id="interview-2">Interview 2</h2>
<p>This interview with 2 team leads and it was ALL technical questions related to the basics of cybersecurity (CIA Triad, authentication, I dont remember the rest) and some application security questions like OWASP top 10, SQLi, XSS, encryption, hashing. But also on how to apply those concepts to a real scenario. Examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How should you store passwords? (Strong hashing algorithm with work factor and salting, but also the users having strong passwords will help too)</li>
<li>How would you implement secure authentication? (Can use a third party authentication, OAuth, or implement secure password checking, with password policies, lockouts, etc - alot of answers work here)</li>
<li>Explain broken authentication from OWASP Top 10 (super simple but also give multiple ways to mitigate)</li>
<li>Hashing vs Encryption, and how does it related to CIA Triad? (confidentiality for encryption, and hashing for integrity, then explain the differences between hashing and encryption)</li>
<li>Explain SQL Injection (I explained it briefly but then I went on about different types of SQLi and how you would actually attack a system)</li>
<li>I can&rsquo;t remember the rest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from the &ldquo;Walk me through your resume&rdquo; and they also dug deeper on a project that I mentioned related to penetration testing.</p>
<p>For the technical questions, some of these were repeat questions from the first interview (basically &ldquo;explain xyz&rdquo; questions). They will probe deeper questions based on your response for clarification, which is good if you know what you&rsquo;re talking about since it makes you look smart on a topic that you&rsquo;re already familiar with.</p>
<p>They gave me example PHP code and I listed the vulnerabilities in that code (it&rsquo;s a super basic 10 line ish program, nothing complex).</p>
<p>There was no behavioral questions.</p>
<p>This interview that I had seemed like she knew more than the interview.</p>
<p>I wanted to make it seem like a conversation, so when I was explaining things to her when giving my thought process, I would intentionally ask, &ldquo;Are you familiar with this?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Have you heard of that?&rdquo;. And sometimes she would say no, which made me feel WAY more confident that I knew more than the interviewer (who is a team leader).</p>
<p>So it was basically another teaching interview and a back and forth conversation. I would also look for if she nodded to see if she approved of my answer.</p>
<p>One question she gave was a super obvious question (&ldquo;Should you always have a strong password for an admin user?&rdquo;).</p>
<p>I said at first yes because an admin user has more permissions than a regular user and can make changes to a system. I paused and thought about the question itself more and why she was asking it.</p>
<p>I then said, it just depends though, like if it&rsquo;s for an application that doesn&rsquo;t have sensitive information, can&rsquo;t really be changed (static website), then in those rare cases, then no.</p>
<p>She then nodded.</p>
<p>I continued with in general, yes an admin user should have a strong password.</p>
<p>Basically, I think she wanted to know if I would give a naive answer, but in my opinion the question was just &ldquo;too obvious&rdquo;, so I had to give more clarity.</p>
<p>I had already passed the Security+, so basic in general cybersecurity questions I was familiar with.</p>
<p>At the end, I asked her, &ldquo;How did I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said I did good, and I would have the recruiter contact me if I made it to the next stage.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>Basically this interview is the same as the first, just show off your knowledge and approach from a teaching perspective. Check in with them if they are following, just like a teacher.</p>
<p>I went deep in explanation just because it gives you more time of talking (so that the interviewer doesn&rsquo;t ask many questions to trick you) but also that you look smart and it also gives you more opportunity to check if they know what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And if they don&rsquo;t, that makes you look like an expert.</p>
<p>Always give more than 1 way to mitigate an attack.</p>
<p>For super obvious scenario questions, give an &ldquo;it depends&rdquo; response to make you look smart, then explain.</p>
<h2 id="interview-3">Interview 3</h2>
<p>This interview was with another 2 team leads, but they have been in the company longer.</p>
<p>This interview, I wasn&rsquo;t able to teach as much since they knew way more than the previous 2 interviews, but I still explained my deep thought process.</p>
<p>They gave me a lot more scenario questions, which I didn&rsquo;t really prepare for (it&rsquo;s harder to since they can come up with any hypothetical scenario).</p>
<p>There was no programming questions, unlike what the recruiter told me.</p>
<p>Examples were:</p>
<ul>
<li>How would you deal with a 0 day exploit? (hard to prevent, but make your detection is solid, and explain an example incident response)</li>
<li>Explain buffer overflow to a nontechnical person (just give an analogy, and use basic words. I also that this before I gave my answer &ldquo;I would make it as simple and brief as possible&rdquo;)</li>
<li>How would you attack a login page (nmap, gobuster, LFI, XSS, SQLi, insecure javascript code, etc - go off on your rant here)</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are done explaining, they might probe deeper questions of what your response included. For example, if I said nmap, they would&rsquo;ve asked after &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in an nmap output?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I would then explain the output but also what it&rsquo;s used for when attacking a system.</p>
<p>Notice how I always give an explanation on top of the answer. Keep in mind in this interview, sometimes I felt like my answers were taking too long so I would address it on the spot &ldquo;I know this answer is a little long, but I feel the need that it&rsquo;s necessary and part of the thought process when you&rsquo;re attacking a system&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If you say that multiple times, just make sure to reword it. You can say the same thing multiple times just reworded since it will sound more natural and less robotic.</p>
<p>I was also asked 1 behavioral question &ldquo;How would you deal with a conflict with a coworker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Super simple response if you&rsquo;ve prepared for it already beforehand (which I did)</p>
<p>I asked some questions at the end, but my final one was &ldquo;How did I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They asked it was basically all good, with exception of my nmap explanation and that it was a little ranty.</p>
<p>After that I got a call a day after saying that I got it and for onboarding steps.</p>
<h2 id="tips-and-tricks">Tips and Tricks</h2>
<p>Aside from the obvious tips like</p>
<ul>
<li>prepare beforehand</li>
<li>dress nice</li>
</ul>
<p>You want to</p>
<ul>
<li>speak slowly but loud (like a presenter on stage)</li>
<li>give in depth explanations (buys you more time, you look smart, and less questions from interviewers)</li>
<li>check in with them while explaining (&ldquo;Are you familiar with that&rdquo;, &ldquo;Do you know what that is?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Have you heard of that?&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I personally had my degree and my Security+ certification hanging in the background, similar to a doctor. It makes you look smart on first impression.</p>
<p>Anywho, this is by far my longest blog post, I hope it was helpful.</p>
